# Session Improvement Plan Template

A reusable format for combining validation results from multiple skill frameworks into a single actionable improvement plan.

---

## Unified Improvement Plan

**Session:** [Session title/name]

### Integrated Recommendations

| Priority | Improvement | [Framework 1] Source | [Framework 2] Source |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | [Primary improvement] | [Principle name] | [Principle name] |
| 2 | [Second improvement] | [Principle name] | [Principle name] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

*Note: Prioritize improvements that address gaps in multiple frameworks simultaneously.*

---

### Improvement 1: [Improvement Title]
**[Optional: Named technique/framework if applicable]**

[Description of the improvement - what to add, change, or enhance]

- **[Component 1]:** [Specific action or element]
- **[Component 2]:** [Specific action or element]
- **[Component 3]:** [Specific action or element]

*Why:* [Brief explanation connecting to both frameworks' principles]

---

### Improvement 2: [Improvement Title]

[Description of the improvement]

| [Context/Location] | [Element] | [Purpose/Rationale] |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| [e.g., Activity 1] | [e.g., Question text] | [e.g., Learning goal] |
| [e.g., Activity 2] | [e.g., Question text] | [e.g., Learning goal] |
| ... | ... | ... |

*Why:* [Brief explanation connecting to both frameworks' principles]

---

### Improvement 3: [Improvement Title]

[Description of the improvement]

| [Dimension 1] | [Dimension 2] | [Options/Values] |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| [e.g., Activity] | [e.g., Variable to manipulate] | [e.g., Range of values] |
| ... | ... | ... |

*Why:* [Brief explanation connecting to both frameworks' principles]

---

### Improvement N: [Improvement Title]

[Continue pattern as needed - use tables for structured data, bullet points for components]

*Why:* [Brief explanation connecting to both frameworks' principles]

---

### Revised Session Flow

```
ACTIVITY 1 ([duration])
├── [Step/element] ([sub-duration if needed])
├── [Step/element]
├── [Improvement element - e.g., Question/Reflection]
├── [Step/element]
└── [Step/element]

ACTIVITY 2 ([duration])
├── [Step/element]
├── [Improvement element]
├── [Step/element]
└── [Step/element]

ACTIVITY N ([duration])
├── [Step/element]
├── [Improvement element]
└── [Step/element]
```

*Note: Use tree structure (├── and └──) to show activity hierarchy. Mark improvement additions distinctly.*

### Summary

[2-4 sentences summarizing the key changes and expected benefits. Structure as:]

This unified plan addresses gaps from both frameworks by:
1. **[Theme 1]** ([brief elaboration])
2. **[Theme 2]** ([brief elaboration])
3. **[Theme 3]** ([brief elaboration])
4. **[Theme 4]** ([brief elaboration])

[Final sentence about overall impact on session quality/player development.]

## Template Usage Guidelines

### When to Use This Template
- After validating a session plan against 2+ skill frameworks
- When combining recommendations from different theoretical perspectives
- To create actionable improvement plans for coaches

### Principles for Integration
1. **Find convergence first** - Identify improvements that satisfy multiple frameworks
2. **Prioritize by impact** - Rank improvements by how many principles they address
3. **Keep it actionable** - Each improvement should have specific, implementable steps
4. **Connect to theory** - Always explain *why* with reference to source principles
5. **Preserve session intent** - Improvements should enhance, not replace, the original design

### Formatting Conventions
- **Tables** for structured comparisons and mappings
- **Bullet points** for components within an improvement
- **Tree diagrams** for session flow visualization
- **Bold** for named techniques or frameworks
- **Italics** for rationale (*Why:* sections)

### Adaptations for Different Framework Counts
- **2 frameworks**: Use the standard table format shown above
- **3+ frameworks**: Add columns to the Integrated Recommendations table
- **Single framework**: Simplify to just improvements without cross-referencing

### Recommended Number of Improvements
- **Minimum**: 3 improvements (covers main gaps)
- **Typical**: 5-7 improvements (comprehensive but digestible)
- **Maximum**: 10 improvements (beyond this, consider phased plans)
